# IITD-autologin
Here is the autologin script for IITD mac and linux (on a vm/rPi) users. 
The script is solid metal - takes care of all sort of state changes that occur example snoring-laptop/router-reset.

# The icing:
The script speaks about its status on the mac and speaks in color!

# Usage:
grab the code!
select the options in the first few active lines of "autocomplete.py" 
$ python autocomplete.py 
It shall prompt for password/ you may just put it in the file as well.

To kill all running instances:
$ sh killer.sh

* Ideally run it on a screen and detach it *

P.S: This is derived from a bash script by the brave soul Shivanker who enlightened the house of Vindhyachal till 2014 when Mark Zuckerberg took him!

DISCLAIMER: This way of logging in is a little insecure to man in the middle attacks. btw, did you install the IITD-certificate? :P

Cheers!
Mayank
