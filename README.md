# IITD-autologin
Here is the autologin script for IITD mac and linux (on a vm/rPi) users. 
The script is solid metal - takes care of all sort of state changes that occur example snoring-laptop/router-reset.

# The icing:
The script speaks about its status on the mac and speaks in color!

P.S: This is derived from a bash script by the brave soul Shivanker who enlightened the house of Vindhyachal till 2014 when Mark Zuckerberg took him!

Cheers!
Mayank
